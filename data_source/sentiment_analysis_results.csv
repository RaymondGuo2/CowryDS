"Ever since signing up its been nothing but a pain trying to sort out the sim card. company didnt seem to understand how i get seamlessly from my existing 02 sim card to the new one i signed up for, having to make up new email adresses and things. Got sent 2 sim cards which was wrong, then it was an ordeal trying to get company to understand the sutuation and they didnt know how to sort it out, i was to be charged for 2 and thats it. The person i spoke to even had the audacity to try and sell me a big multi sim card deal!! I only want one, the one i signed up for, not the 2 i was sent or any more on top of it. Eventually spoke to 02 and they were sound",positive,0.14,0.49

The router did not cover the whole of the house so computer at back of house ran very slow. Also would need to keep answer phone and hive hub in front room - not good. When I rang to cancel I was told there was at least a 7 day delay that I was going to have to pay for - even though I was cancelling the very next day after activation the service. I was also told there was a high connection charge - which was not the case for when I registered for the service I was told there would be no connection charge. When this was pointed out the telephone operator checked and agreed there was no connection charge but I would be paying for the service for the next seven days at least. I am not happy about this - I used the service for two days at most - the day it was activated and the day it was cancelled. (wed 3rd May and Thursday 4th May) and I didn't even connect up the TV or use the company tv box.,negative,-0.07,0.36

"Your customer service is awful and you really need to ditch the overseas call centers. Kindness and understanding in the voice go a long way. You can feel the contempt in operator voices (sniggering and laughing when you say you cannot understnd what they are saying - feels intentional) and cannot quite get all of the words due to very strong accents. Your only saving grace is the physical connection and stability of that. Thankfully, because connection quality is good I rarely (if ever - Thank Goodness) have to contact your call centers. Would not touch with a barge pole otherwise. Take a look at Now Broadband whos operators are absolutely marvellous. Lessons learned or brushed under the carpet? Haha",negative,0.08,0.57

"The Engineer that visited to install the cable was exceptionally good, personable, a very good communicator, and most importantly didn't stop the installation when faced with obstructions, but rather, he overcame the obstructions to ensure the installation was completed. To elaborate, there was a hedge against the wall where the cable had to come through, most modern day engineers would stop the job at that point and cite the hedge as an obstruction, but not Stevie, he got in to the hedge to ensure the job got done. I was really impressed.",positive,0.59,0.71

"I have had to call company everyday. 15/05/23 spoke to at least 10 different people in 10 different departments. Each time having to re-explain the situation, one member said yes they can activate internet but in a different department, got to that department they said it couldn't be done... No manager was available to talk to. I have been told activation will happen on 3 different dates due to companys delays. This has caused me to loose wages from work as I work from home and rely on the internet to work. My son is disabled and uses the internet to communicate, so has had 3 days of non communication so far. I am speaking to other suppliers and will be cancelling with company within my 30day cooling off period. I will not under any circumstances recommend company and I will be publishing my experience on social media. You need to get your departments organised, leadership needs to be held accountable and staff clearly need more adequate training.",negative,0.03,0.46
